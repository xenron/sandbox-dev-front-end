		<h1>Collaborative Document Editing</h1>
			<p><b>Document Editor</b> offers you the possibility to work at a document collaboratively with other users. This feature includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>simultaneous multi-user access to the edited document</li>
				<li>visual indication of passages that are being edited by other users</li>
				<li>synchronization of changes with one button click</li>
				<li>chat to share ideas concerning particular document parts</li>
				<li>comments containing the description of a task or problem that should be solved</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Co-editing</h3>
			<p>When a document is being edited by several users simultaneously, the edited text passages are marked with dashed lines of different colors. By hovering the mouse cursor over one of the edited passages, the name of the user who is editing it at the moment is displayed. The number of users who are working at the current document is specified in the left lower corner at the status bar - <img alt="Number of users icon" src="../images/usersnumber.png" />. 
			To see who exactly are editing the file now, move the mouse cursor over this icon - users' names will be displayed in a pop-up window. If too many users are editing the document, click on this icon to open the <b>Chat</b> panel with the full list of the users.</p>
			<p>As soon as one of the users saves his/her changes by clicking the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/savewhilecoediting.png" /> icon, the others will see a note within the status bar stating that they have updates. To save the changes you made, so that other users can view them, and get the updates saved by your co-editors, click the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon in the left upper corner of the top toolbar. The updates will be highlighted for you to check what exactly has been changed.</p>
			<p>You can specify what changes you want to be highlighted during co-editing if you click the <img alt="File icon" src="../images/file.png" /> icon at the left sidebar, select the <b>Advanced Settings...</b> option and choose between <b>none</b>, <b>all</b> and <b>last</b> realtime collaboration changes. Selecting <b>View all</b> changes, all the changes made during the current session will be highlighted. Selecting <b>View last</b> changes, only the changes made since you last time clicked the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon will be highlighted. Selecting <b>View None</b> changes, changes made during the current session will not be highlighted.</p>
			<h3>Chat</h3>
			<p>To access the chat and leave a message for other users,</p>

			<p>All the messages left by users will be displayed on the panel on the left. If there are new messages you haven't read yet, the chat icon will look like this - <img alt="Chat icon" src="../images/chaticon_new.png" />.</p>
			<p>To close the panel with chat messages, click the <img alt="Chat icon" src="../images/chaticon.png" /> icon once again.</p>

			<p>The text passage you commented will be highlighted in the document. To view the comment, just click within the passage. If you need to disable this feature, click the <img alt="File icon" src="../images/file.png" /> icon, select the <b>Advanced Settings...</b> option and uncheck the <b>Turn on live commenting option</b> box. In this case the commented passages will be highlighted only if you click the <img alt="Comments icon" src="../images/commentsicon.png" /> icon.</p>

			<ul>

				<li>delete them by clicking the <img alt="Delete icon" src="../images/deletecommenticon.png" /> icon,</li>
				<li>close the discussion by clicking the <b>Resolve</b> link if the task or problem you stated in your comment was solved, after that the discussion you opened with your comment gets the resolved status. To open it again, click the <b>Resolved</b> caption next to it and select the <b>Open Again</b> option.</li>
