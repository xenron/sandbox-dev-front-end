				<tr>
					<td>Font Name</td>
					<td><img alt="Font Name" src="../images/fontfamily.png" /></td>
					<td>Is used to select one of the fonts from the list of the available ones.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Font Size</td>
					<td><img alt="Font Size" src="../images/fontsize.png" /></td>
					<td>Is used to select among the preset font size values from the dropdown list, or can be entered manually to the font size field.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Highlight Color</td>
					<td><img alt="Highlight Color" src="../images/highlightcolor.png" /></td>
					<td>Is used to mark separate sentences, phrases, words, or even characters by adding a color band that imitates highlighter pen effect around the text. You can select the necessary part of the text and then click the downward arrow next to the icon to select a color on the palette (this color set does not depend on the selected <b>Color Scheme</b> and includes 16 colors) - the color will be applied to the text selection. Alternatively, you can first choose a highlight color and then start selecting the text with the mouse - the mouse pointer will look like this <img alt="Mouse pointer while highlighting" src="../images/highlight_color_mouse_pointer.png" /> and you'll be able to highlight several different parts of your text sequentially. To stop highlighting just click the icon once again. To clear the highlight color, choose the <b>No Fill</b> option. <b>Highlight Color</b> is different from the <a href="../UsageInstructions/BackgroundColor.htm"><b>Background Color</b></a> <img alt="Paragraph Background Color Icon" src="../images/backgroundcolor.png" /> as the latter is applied to the whole paragraph and completely fills all the paragraph space from the left page margin to the right page margin.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Font Color</td>
					<td><img alt="Font Color" src="../images/fontcolor.png" /></td>
					<td>Is used to change the color of the letters/characters in the text. By default, the automatic font color is set in a new blank document. It is displayed as a black font on the white background. If you change the background color into black, the font color will automatically change into white to keep the text clearly visible. To choose a different color, click the downward arrow next to the icon and select a color from the available palettes (the colors on the <b>Theme Colors</b> palette depend on the selected <a href="../UsageInstructions/ChangeColorScheme.htm">color scheme</a>). After you change the default font color, you can use the <b>Automatic</b> option in the color palettes window to quickly restore the automatic color for the selected text passage.</td>
