			<h1>Insert page numbers</h1>
			<p>To insert page numbers into your document,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>click the <b>Edit Header or Footer</b> <img alt="Edit Header or Footer icon" src="../images/headerfooter.png" /> icon at the top toolbar,</li>
				<li>choose the <b>Insert Page Number</b> submenu,</li>
				<li>select one of the following options:
					<ul>
						<li>To put a page number to each page of your document, select the page number position on the page.</li>
						<li>To insert a page number at the current cursor position, select the <b>To Current Position</b> option.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<p>To edit the page number settings,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>double-click the page number added,</li>
				<li>change the current parameters at the right sidebar: 
				<p><img alt="Right Sidebar - Header and Footer Settings" src="../images/right_headerfooter.png" /></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Set the <b>Position</b> of page numbers on the page as well as relative to the top and bottom of the page.</li>
				<li>Check the <b>Different first page</b> box to apply a different page number to the very first page or in case you don't want to add any number to it at all. </li>
				<li>Use the <b>Different odd and even pages</b> box to insert different page numbers for odd and even pages. </li>
				<li>The <b>Link to Previous</b> option is available in case you've previously added <a href="../UsageInstructions/SectionBreaks.htm">sections</a> into your document. If not, it will be grayed out. Moreover, this option is also unavailable for the very first section (i.e. when a header or footer that belongs to the first section is selected). By default, this box is checked, so that unified numbering is applied to all the sections. If you select a header or footer area, you will see that the area is marked with the <b>Same as Previous</b> label. Uncheck the <b>Link to Previous</b> box to use different page numbering for each section of the document, for example, to start each section numbering at 1. The <b>Same as Previous</b> label will no longer be displayed.</li>
				</ul>
