			<h1>Align and arrange objects on a slide</h1>
			<p>The added <b>autoshapes, images, charts</b> or <b>text blocks</b> can be aligned, grouped, ordered, distributed horizontally and vertically on a slide. To perform any of these actions, first select a separate object or several objects in the slide editing area. To select several objects, hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and left-click the necessary objects. To select a text block, click on its border, not the text within it. After that you can use either the top toolbar icons described below or the analogous options from the right-click menu.</p>
			<p>To <b>align</b> the selected object(s), click the <b>Align Shape</b> <img alt="Align Shape icon" src="../images/alignshape.png" /> icon at the top toolbar and select the necessary alignment type from the list:</p>
			    <ul>
			    <li><b>Align Left</b> <img alt="Align Left icon" src="../images/alignobjectleft.png" /> - to line up the object(s) horizontally by the left side of the slide,</li>
			    <li><b>Align Center</b> <img alt="Align Center icon" src="../images/alignobjectcenter.png" /> - to line up the object(s) horizontally by the center of the slide,</li>
			    <li><b>Align Right</b> <img alt="Align Right icon" src="../images/alignobjectright.png" /> - to line up the object(s) horizontally by the right side of the slide,</li>
			    <li><b>Align Top</b> <img alt="Align Top icon" src="../images/alignobjecttop.png" /> - to line up the object(s) vertically by the top side of the slide,</li>
			    <li><b>Align Middle</b> <img alt="Align Middle icon" src="../images/alignobjectmiddle.png" /> - to line up the object(s) vertically by the middle of the slide,</li>
			    <li><b>Align Bottom</b> <img alt="Align Bottom icon" src="../images/alignobjectbottom.png" />  - to line up the object(s) vertically by the bottom side of the slide.</li>
			    </ul>
			<p>To <b>distribute</b> two or more selected objects horizontally or vertically<!--so that the equal distance appears between them-->, click the <b>Align Shape</b> <img alt="Align Shape icon" src="../images/alignshape.png" /> icon at the top toolbar and select the necessary distribution type from the list:</p>
			    <ul>
			    <li><b>Distribute Horizontally</b> <img alt="Distribute Horizontally icon" src="../images/distributehorizontally.png" /> - <!--to distribute objects evenly between the most left and most right objects on a slide-->to align the selected objects by their centers (from right to left edges) to the horizontal center of the slide</li>
			    <li><b>Distribute Vertically</b> <img alt="Distribute Vertically icon" src="../images/distributevertically.png" /> - <!--to distribute objects evenly between the most top and most bottom objects on a slide-->to align the selected objects by their centers (from top to bottom edges) to the vertical center of the slide.</li>
			    </ul>
		    <p>To <b>arrange</b> the selected object(s) (i.e. to change their order when several objects overlap each other), click the <b>Arrange Shape</b> <img alt="Arrange Shape icon" src="../images/arrangeshape.png" /> icon at the top toolbar and select the necessary arrangement type from the list:</p>
			    <ul>
			    <li><b>Bring To Foreground</b> <img alt="Bring To Front icon" src="../images/bringtofront.png" /> - to move the object(s) in front of all other objects,</li>
			    <li><b>Send To Background</b> <img alt="Send To Back icon" src="../images/sendtoback.png" /> - to move the object(s) behind all other objects,</li>
			    <li><b>Move Forward</b> <img alt="Bring Forward icon" src="../images/bringforward.png" /> - to move the selected object(s) by one level forward as related to other objects.</li>
			    <li><b>Move Backward</b> <img alt="Send Backward icon" src="../images/sendbackward.png" /> - to move the selected object(s) by one level backward as related to other objects.</li>
			    </ul>
			<p>To <b>group</b> two or more selected objects or <b>ungroup</b> them, click the <b>Arrange Shape</b> <img alt="Arrange Shape icon" src="../images/arrangeshape.png" /> icon at the top toolbar and select the necessary option from the list:</p>
			    <ul>
			    <li><b>Group</b> <img alt="Group icon" src="../images/group.png" /> - to join several objects into a group so that they can be simultaneously rotated, moved, resized, aligned, arranged, copied, pasted, formatted like a single object.</li>
			    <li><b>Ungroup</b> <img alt="Ungroup icon" src="../images/ungroup.png" /> - to ungroup the selected group of the previously joined objects.</li>
			    </ul>
