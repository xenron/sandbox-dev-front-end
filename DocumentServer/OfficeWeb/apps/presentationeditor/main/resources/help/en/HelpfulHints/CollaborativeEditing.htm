			<h1>Collaborative Presentation Editing</h1>
			<p><b>Presentation Editor</b> offers you the possibility to work at a presentation collaboratively with other users. This feature includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>simultaneous multi-user access to the edited presentation</li>
				<li>visual indication of objects that are being edited by other users</li>
				<li>synchronization of changes with one button click</li>
				<li>chat to share ideas concerning particular presentation parts</li>
				<li>comments containing the description of a task or problem that should be solved</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Co-editing</h3>
			<p>When a presentation is being edited by several users simultaneously, the edited objects (autoshapes, text placeholders and blocks, tables, images, charts) are marked with dashed lines of different colors. The object that you are editing is surrounded by the green dashed line. Red dashed lines indicate that objects are being edited by other users. By hovering the mouse cursor over one of the edited objects, the name of the user who is editing it at the moment is displayed. The number of users who are working at the current presentation is specified in the left lower corner at the status bar - <img alt="Number of users icon" src="../images/usersnumber.png" />. 
			To see who exactly are editing the file now, move the mouse cursor over this icon - users' names will be displayed in a pop-up window. If too many users are editing the presentation, click on this icon to open the <b>Chat</b> panel with the full list of the users.</p>
			<p>As soon as one of the users saves his/her changes by clicking the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/savewhilecoediting.png" /> icon, the others will see a note within the status bar stating that they have updates. To save the changes you made, so that other users can view them, and get the updates saved by your co-editors, click the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon in the left upper corner of the top toolbar. The updates will be highlighted for you to check what exactly has been changed.</p>
			<p>You can specify what changes you want to be highlighted during co-editing if you click the <img alt="File icon" src="../images/file.png" /> icon at the left sidebar, select the <b>Advanced Settings...</b> option and choose between <b>all</b> and <b>last</b> realtime collaboration changes. Selecting <b>View all</b> changes, all the changes made during the current session will be highlighted. Selecting <b>View last</b> changes, only the changes made since you last time clicked the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon will be highlighted.</p>
			<h3>Chat</h3>
			<p>To access the chat and leave a message for other users,</p>

			<p>All the messages left by users will be displayed on the panel on the left. If there are new messages you haven't read yet, the chat icon will look like this - <img alt="Chat icon" src="../images/chaticon_new.png" />.</p>
