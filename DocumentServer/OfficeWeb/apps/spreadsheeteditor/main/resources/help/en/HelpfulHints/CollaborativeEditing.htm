		<h1>Collaborative Spreadsheet Editing</h1>
			<p><b>Spreadsheet Editor</b> offers you the possibility to work at a spreadsheet collaboratively with other users. This feature includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>simultaneous multi-user access to the edited spreadsheet</li>
				<li>visual indication of cells that are being edited by other users</li>
				<li>synchronization of changes with one button click</li>
				<li>chat to share ideas concerning particular spreadsheet parts</li>
				<li>comments containing the description of a task or problem that should be solved</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Co-editing</h3>
			<p>When a spreadsheet is being edited by several users simultaneously, the edited cells as well as the tab of the sheet where these cells are situated are marked with dashed lines of different colors. Hover the mouse cursor over one of the edited cells to display the name of the user who is editing it at the moment. The number of users who are working at the current document is specified in the right lower corner at the status bar - <img alt="Number of users icon" src="../images/usersnumber.png" />.</p>
			<p>As soon as one of the users saves his/her changes by clicking the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/savewhilecoediting.png" /> icon, the others will see a note in the upper left corner stating that they have updates. To save the changes you made, so that other users can view them, and get the updates saved by your co-editors, click the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon in the left upper corner of the top toolbar.</p>
