			<h1>Manipulate objects</h1>
			<p>You can resize, move, rotate and arrange autoshapes, images and charts inserted into your worksheet.</p>
			<h3>Resize objects</h3>
			<p>To change the autoshape/image/chart <b>size</b>, drag small squares <img alt="Square icon" src="../images/resize_square.png" /> situated on the object edges. To maintain the original proportions of the selected object while resizing, hold down the <b>Shift</b> key and drag one of the corner icons.</p>
			<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: to resize the inserted chart or image you can also use the right sidebar that will be activated once you select the necessary object. To open it, click the <b>Chart Settings</b> <img alt="Chart Settings icon" src="../images/chart.png" />  or the <b>Image Settings</b> <img alt="Image Settings icon" src="../images/image_settings_icon.png" /> icon to the right.
			<p><img alt="Maintaining proportions" src="../images/maintain_proportions.png" /></p>
			<h3>Move objects</h3>
			<p>To alter the autoshape/image/chart <b>position</b>, use the <img alt="Arrow" src="../images/arrow.png" /> icon that appears after hovering your mouse cursor over the object. Drag the object to the necessary position without releasing the mouse button. 
			To move the object by the one-pixel increments, hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and use the keybord arrows. 
			To move the object strictly horizontally/vertically and prevent it from moving in a perpendicular direction, hold down the <b>Shift</b> key when dragging.</p>
			<h3>Rotate objects</h3>
			<p>To <b>rotate</b> the autoshape/image, hover the mouse cursor over the rotation handle <img alt="Rotation Handle" src="../images/greencircle.png" /> and drag it clockwise or counterclockwise. To constrain the rotation angle to 15 degree increments, hold down the <b>Shift</b> key while rotating.</p>
			<h3>Reshape autoshapes</h3>
			<p>When modifying some shapes, for example Figured arrows or Callouts, the yellow diamond-shaped <img alt="Yellow diamond icon" src="../images/yellowdiamond.png" /> icon is also available. It allows to adjust some aspects of the shape, for example, the length of the head of an arrow.</p>
			<p><img alt="Reshaping autoshape" src="../images/reshaping.png" /></p>
			<h3>Arrange several objects</h3>
			<p>If you have several objects (autoshapes, images and charts) overlapped you can arrange their order clicking the necessary object with the mouse and selecting the desired arrangement type from the right-click menu:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Bring to Foreground</b> - to move the selected object in front of all other objects,</li>
				<li><b>Send to Background</b> - to move the selected object behind all other objects,</li>
				<li><b>Move Forward</b> - to move the selected object by one level forward as related to other objects,</li>
				<li><b>Move Backward</b> - to move the selected object by one level backward as related to other objects.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Group several objects</h3>
			<p>To manipulate several objects at once, you can <b>group</b> them. Hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key while selecting the objects with the mouse, then right-click to open the context menu and select the <b>Group</b> option.</p>
			<p><img alt="Grouping objects" src="../images/grouping.png" /></p>
			<p>To ungroup them, select the grouped objects with the mouse and use the <b>Ungroup</b> option from the right-click menu.</p>
