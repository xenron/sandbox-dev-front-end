			<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: only the data in the upper-left cell of the selected range will remain in the merged cell. Data in other cells of the selected range will be deleted.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>if you select the <b>Merge &amp; Center</b> option the cells of the selected range will be merged and the data will be centered in the merged cells;</li>
			<li>if you select the <b>Merge Across</b> option the cells of each row of the selected range will be merged and the data will be aligned to the left side of the merged cells;</li>
			<li>if you select the <b>Merge Cells</b> option the cells of the selected range will be merged and the data will be aligned by the bottom vertically and by the left side horizontally.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
