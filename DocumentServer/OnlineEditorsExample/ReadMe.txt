For the TeamLab Office Applications example to work properly you need to do the following:

1. Download and extract the TeamLabOfficeAppsExample.zip into a directory selected for it, for instance, C:\TeamLabOfficeAppsExample

2. Use the settings.config file to change the received authorization key for the document service. The file can be found in the unpacked root folder (C:\TeamLabOfficeAppsExample\settings.config, in our example). The authorization key is specified in the files.docservice.key field.

3. Run the IIS Manager (C:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\InetMgr.exe or Start -> All Programs -> Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager for Windows Server 2003)

4. Add the unpacked TeamLabOfficeAppsExample to the list of sites with the physical path to the C:\TeamLabOfficeAppsExample (or the one you selected) folder.

5. Make sure that the user account under which the IIS NetworkService process is executed has the write access rights for the C:\TeamLabOfficeAppsExample\App_Data folder (this is significant for the IIS later than 6.0).

6. Make the created TeamLab Office Applications example available through IP or domain name so that it could be connected from the web by the document service for proper document rendering.
