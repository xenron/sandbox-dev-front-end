# Custom React Example
This example demonstrates integrating custom react components. For simplicity, we've created a parent UI component that mirrors the Pyxley `FilterChart` component.

# How to Install
Make sure pyxley is installed first (run `python setup.py install`).

## NPM
Install NPM (e.g brew install node).

## Webpack
This app has a custom webpack file. Rather than building
the `webpack.config.js` the app uses the one in the top-level
folder.

Simple install the `node_modules` with
`npm install`

# Flask
Run `python project/app.py`.

## NV-D3
This example uses a modified `NV-D3` chart containing a dual-axis line plot with a focus chart. It is adapted from the [Line Chart with View Finder example](http://nvd3.org/examples/lineWithFocus.html).
